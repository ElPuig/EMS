	#index -> should be computed using the record section but some content is fixed
	#	1. Last record approval (if exists).
	#	2. Last agreements review.
	#	3. Regular meeting content. where each record section should have.
	#		3.1. Title.
	#		3.2. The content or another section.
	#		NOTE: pending topics of the last meeting could be added.
	#	4. Agreements
	#	5. Pending topics.
	#	6. Signature
	#		6.1. By the user who created the record (will be signed by clicking on a button).
	#		6.2. By another user who aproves it, should be loaded as manager of the previous one, but this could limit some scenearios so it"s better to let it free.
	#			 The redactor adds the aprover, and a notification will be sent. The aprover can aprove the record or not.
	#			 The record can be edited, but then it becomes desaproved. 
	#
	#	7. Attachments (this will allow to attach any custom document).
	#
	#	PENDING: changes registry?
