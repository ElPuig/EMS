                                        1. The filed "course_id" should be read-only.
                                        2. On install, the current course should be generated and assigned (the default course values can be used). 
                                        3. Next to it, there should be a button called "Setup next course". On clicking, a warning should alert about what is going to happen:
                                            All static data will remain (students, teachers, subjects, etc.)
                                            All the expirable data will be moved to a read-only history (student's enrollments including grades, teachers assignations and schedules, etc.) and cleared in order to setup the new ones. 
                                            THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE (study if a BBDD backup can be done in the background before changing anything). OLD DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE JUST FOR CONSULTING, BUT NOT MODIFICABLE.
